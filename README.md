Hi there! This is an implementation of the command line tool, translate (tr) present in Unix.

Functionalities achieved so far:
Supports simple substitutions (Replacing occurances of a single letter)
Supports translating between alphabetic character ranges (e.g, can translate from A-Z to b-x, etc...)

Future Goals:
Support various classes of translation as is present in the tr tool

Support Character deletion

Support Character Squashing
